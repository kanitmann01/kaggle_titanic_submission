## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** with optimized hyperparameters:
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest with Gini criterion
- **N Estimators**: 100 trees
- **Max Depth**: 5 levels
- **Min Samples Split**: 3
- **Kaggle Score**: 0.74401 (solid performance)

### Features Used:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Age
- Gender (Sex)
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Ticket fare (Fare)
- Port of embarkation (Embarked)

## 📊 Historical Insights

The model reveals fascinating patterns from the Titanic disaster:

- **Women & Children First**: 74% of women survived vs 19% of men
- **Class Disparity**: 1st class (63%), 2nd class (47%), 3rd class (24%)
- **Family Size**: Small families had better survival rates
- **Age Factor**: Children had higher survival rates than adults
